/// The `Component` trait encapsulates all of the initialization and
/// configuration of a kernel extension inside the `finalize()` function
/// call. The `Output` type defines what type this component generates.
/// Note that instantiating a component does not necessarily
/// instantiate the underlying `Output` type; instead, it is typically
/// instantiated in the `finalize()` method. If instantiating and
/// initializing the `Output` type requires parameters, these should be
/// passed in the component's `new()` function.
