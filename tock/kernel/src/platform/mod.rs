///
/// ```ignore
/// struct Hail {
///     console: &'static capsules::console::Console<'static>,
///     ipc: kernel::ipc::IPC,
///     dac: &'static capsules::dac::Dac<'static>,
/// }

///     {
///         match driver_num {
///             capsules::console::DRIVER_NUM => f(Some(self.console)),

///             _ => f(None),
///         }
